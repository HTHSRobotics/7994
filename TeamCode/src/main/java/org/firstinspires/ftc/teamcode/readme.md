### A Quick Guide
- `opmodes`: This packages contains all opmodes. Each file must be suffixed with `_auto` or `_tele` to indicate the type of opmode.
- `utils`: This package contains any utility classes or custom class extensions we might have.
- `subsystems`: This package is the home of all robot subsystems. They are organized based on isolated function; e.g. what is required to intake a block, what is required to lift a block, or what is required to place a capstone.
- `commands`: Here is where you will find all commands that are possible for the robot.
